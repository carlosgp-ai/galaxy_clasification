## Abstract
Today there is a great revolution in the Astronomy world, the power of the current telescopes is leading to great discoveries such as the first images of black holes or the discovery of exoplanets. In collaboration with the Canarias Astrophysical Institute, a solution based on Artificial Intelligence has been proposed to facilitate the identification of twin Galaxies and thus carry out studies between Galaxies that have the active nucleus (AGN) and their selected twins that do not. Deep Learning, one area of Artificial Intelligence, will allow us to perform, through computer vision and more specifically through the algorithms of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a ranking of twin galaxies of the chosen AGNs. Finally, as a future and innovative study we will use another algorithm, the Siamese Neural Networks, which is currently used mainly for facial recognition and we will try to adapt it to obtain the ranking of galaxies similarity.
